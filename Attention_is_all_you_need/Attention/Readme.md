## Introduction
- The limitation of Seq2seq: Original Seq2seq concepts was hard to represent the entire data using one context-vector at the encoding phase.
- Especially when long sequence length (Corpus) will occur the significant problems.

## Contribution: Not utilizing fixed-length vetor encoding method


## Model
- Bidirectional RNN structure
- Calculate each context vector Ci's probability
